# DistinctionOS

### DistinctionOS is built upon [Bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite). DistinctionOS is intended as a full experience and the opposite of minimalism. 
##### Please note: I'm not a Developer, Just someone who keeps tinkering until something finally works and sometimes I learn from it.

# Noteable Additions
 #### Cider (Apple Music Client) 
 - See: [Cider collective](https://cider.sh/)
 -  **NOTE:** ***This is Cider version 3. You need to purchase an license from itch.io to use it, But it should be a one-time payment. See: https://cidercollective.itch.io/cider You will still need an active Apple Music subscription to use it.***
 #### xpadneo
 - [xpadneo](https://github.com/atar-axis/xpadneo) compiled from source.
 - Xpadneo is here for controller input over bluetooth and support for xbox series elite controllers (which I have and use)
 
 #### BlackBox-Terminal
  [BlackBox-Terminal](https://github.com/yonasBSD/blackbox-terminal) BlackBox-Terminal is currently unmaintained But I still love it, Which is why it's here. 
 
 #### Audacity (Freeworld)
 - [Audacity](https://github.com/audacity/audacity) [Freeworld spec](https://github.com/rpmfusion/audacity-freeworld/blob/master/audacity-freeworld.spec) 'Freeworld' is better than fedora's default audacity package in the sense that it ships patent encumbered codecs that fedora can't/won't ship in their official repositories. (If you use audacity, Consider donating!)
 
### Misc
 - [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
 - [dysk](https://github.com/Canop/dysk)
 - Flatpak-builder 
 - Various apps that bazzite wants as flatpak that are now reinstalled as native RPMs
 - Image-raw thumbnails (tested with Sony's .ARW format from my own camera. Other formats untested.)
 - Video thumbnails
 - .dds texture thumbnails (This won't work for every last texture, but should work on most)

 ### Misc /bin
- advcp
- advmv
- rpm-ostree-search-hl (rpm-ostree search highlighting)
- xiso renamed from: [extract-xiso](https://github.com/XboxDev/extract-xiso)
